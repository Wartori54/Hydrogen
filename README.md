# Hydrogen Celeste Mod
Simple mod that uncaps the update loop and lets you run the game as fast as you CPU can.

In order to achieve higher speeds some optimizations were implemented, those can be toggled in game.

It is recommended to play with at least an optimization level of 1, otherwise the sound engine may freeze the game

## Building
Let your IDE handle it, but it should be as simple as
`dotnet build`
on the root directory of this repository.
